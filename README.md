# Overview

ValStoreTracker is an app that enables you to view the Valorant in-game store from your iPhone and more. This is easier than having to start the game client every day just to check if your favourite skin is available.

##### What is Valorant?
Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, featuring team-based gameplay.

##### What is the Valorant Store?
The Valorant skin store is an in-game marketplace where players can purchase cosmetic items such as weapon skins and other customization options. Each player has a unique shop that rotates daily.

# App Store

I won't be uploading the app to the App Store for the following reasons:
- I have developed this app primarily for personal use
- I created this app to learn about app/web development
- There are other store trackers out there ( if not taken down by Riot Games)
- It violates Riot's Policy
